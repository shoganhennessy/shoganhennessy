My name is Senan, and I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at [Cornell University](https://economics.cornell.edu/senan-hogan-hennessy), where my research focuses on estimating causal effects and applications in economics.

I host the materials behind my research work here, in an open-source manner -- except when data are not shareable.

- 👨‍🏫👩‍🏫 [state-faculty-composition](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-faculty-composition), "Changes in Faculty Composition and Stagnating State Support for Higher Education" (2022), an empirical economics project using data on universities, and public data on professors in the state of Illinois.
