My name is Senan, and I am a PhD student in the Economics Department at [Cornell University](https://economics.cornell.edu/senan-hogan-hennessy), where I research labour economics.

I host the data and materials behind my research work here, open-source when possible:

- 👨‍🏫👩‍🏫 [Less Funding, More Lecturers, and Fewer Professors (2024)](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-funding-faculty/), an economics project connecting falling US education funding with substituting professors for lecturers.
The Github repo hosts the replication package and data.
