My name is Senan, and I am a PhD student in the Economics Department at [Cornell University](https://economics.cornell.edu/senan-hogan-hennessy), where I research labour economics.

I host the data and materials behind my research work here, open-source when possible:

- 📈📉 [Causal Mediation in Natural Experiments (2025)](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/mediation-natural-experiment/), applied econometrics project showing how mediation works (or does not work) in a quasi-experimental/observational setting --- and what to do about it.
The Github repo hosts the working paper, and simulation code.

- 👨‍🏫👩‍🏫 [Less Funding, More Lecturers, and Fewer Professors (2024)](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-funding-faculty/), an economics project connecting falling US education funding with substituting professors for lecturers.
The Github repo hosts the paper, replication package, and public data.
